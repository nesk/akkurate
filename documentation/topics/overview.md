# Overview

%product% is a validation library taking advantage of the expressive power of Kotlin. No need \
for 30+ annotations or complicated custom constraints; write your validation code in Kotlin with a beautiful declarative
API.

Designed from scratch to handle complex business logic, its role is to help you write qualitative and maintainable
validation code.

> %product% is under development and, despite being heavily tested, its API isn't yet stabilized; _breaking changes
> might happen on minor releases._ However, we will always provide migration guides.

## Features

- **Beautiful DSL and API.** Write crystal clear validation code and keep it <tooltip term="DRY">DRY</tooltip>. Use
  loops and conditions when needed; forget about annotation hell.
- **Bundled with all the essential constraints.** Write custom constraints for your business logic and nothing more. The
  rest? It's on us!
- **Easily and highly extendable.** No need to write verbose code to create custom constraints, within %product% they're
  as simple as a lambda with parameters.
- **Contextual and asynchronous.** Query sync/async data sources whenever you need to, like a database, or a REST API.
  Everything can happen inside validation.
- ![Coming soon](clock.png){width="16"} **Testable out of the box.** Finding how to test your validation code shouldn't
  be one of your tasks. You will find all the tools you need to write good tests.
- ![Coming soon](clock.png){width="16"} **Integrated with your favorite tools.** Validate your data within any popular
  framework, we take care of the integrations for you.
- ![Coming soon](clock.png){width="16"} **Code once, deploy everywhere.** Take advantage of Kotlin Multiplatform; write
  your validation code once, use it both for front-end and back-end usages.

> Features marked with ![Coming soon](clock.png){width="16"} are on the roadmap.
